			I am an emerging artist living in New York City for the past 4 years and currently reside in lower Manhattan. I am a self-taught painter who was fortunate enough to secure an apprenticeship in Paris with artist Laurent Godard in "Flateurville" and for a time painter Eric Bourse near Annecy. However, I have been drawing since I was very young and pride myself as a draftsman. Working in the service industry as a bartender and once barista I explore the people and culture around town. I use oil paint to give light the scenes I encounter while visiting cafes, friends, shows, and restaurants in the NYC boroughs and the Northeast. Color and composition are as important to me as the subjects themselves. Color, form, and technique are all implemented in many different ways in order to support the composition of the work. A narrative is generally achieved in a more subtle context, but is always present.  I hope to represent beauty in my subjects. They are my friends, plants, & daily sights that are unavoidable in New York City and might strike me in the moment as unforgettable. I am interested in capturing these fleeting moments of activity that are both personal yet universal. They are casual observations of the miscellaneous and at the same time demonstrate the connectivity among beings.
